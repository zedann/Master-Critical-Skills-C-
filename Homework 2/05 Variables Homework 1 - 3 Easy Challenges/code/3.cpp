Given 8 space-separated integers, find the sum of those in even places and the sum of those in odd places.

Note: Even place means the 2nd, 4th, 6th or 8th numbers, while odd places are the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th numbers.

Example Input:
11 2 7 9 12 -8 3 -1

Example Output:
2 33

Example Explanation:
2 + 9 + (-8) + (-1) = 2
11 + 7 + 12 + 3 = 33

	/*
	 * We know we will read 8 numbers
	 * 	The first number is the first odd
	 * 	The third number is the second odd
	 * 	The fifth number is the their odd
	 * 	The seventh number is the forth odd
	 *
	 * Same logic for even numbers
	 *
	 * The key: good naming variables and read them in right order
